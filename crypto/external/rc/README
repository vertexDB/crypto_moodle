Requirments:
To run, this implimentation requires all default packages in python 3.6 (lower versions will not work, this implimentation
uses the 'secrets' library that was introduced in python 3.6


Usages:
	main.py: Library wrapper for the RC5 implimentation I have written. Allows for encryption and decryption
	of files, as well as text from the command line. The argument syntax is as follows.
		Base arguments
		usage: main.py [-h] [--cmdtext] {encrypt,decrypt} ...

		positional arguments:
		  {encrypt,decrypt}
			encrypt          Option to select to encrypt input
			decrypt          Option to select to decrypt input

		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
		  --cmdtext          Specifiy this command to treat the 'infile' argument as
							 the text the encrypt

		usage: main.py encrypt [-h] [--blocksize {32,64,128}] [--keysize KEYSIZE]
							   [--rounds ROUNDS]
							   infile outfile

		positional arguments:
		  infile                The plaintext wanted to be encrypted/decrypted
		  outfile               Name of output encrypted file

		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
		  --blocksize {32,64,128}
								The block size in bits for the cipher to operate on
								the input data (32, 64, 128), default 64
		  --keysize KEYSIZE     The key size in bits for the cihper to generate
								(0-2040), default 128
		  --rounds ROUNDS       The number of rounds used in the key expansion
								(0-255), default 12
								
		usage: main.py decrypt [-h] infile key outfile

		positional arguments:
		  infile      The plaintext wanted to be encrypted/decrypted
		  key         The file generated holding the key during encryption
		  outfile     Name of output unencrypted file

		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
